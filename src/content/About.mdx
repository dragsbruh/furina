# hai chat :3

im a dev and a student.

i mostly write in **zig &lt;3** and **go**, and sometimes **python**, and **typescript (on bun)**,
because i like my tools fast, and simple. i use **arch, btw**.

## im currently working on:

- [my homelab](#homelab)
- [high performance byte-byte markov chain](https://github.com/dragsbruh/grall)
- selfhosted manga reader/catalog because there isnt a good option for me :(

if it involves performance, systems, or building cursed stuff, im in.

## tech i use

<Tech />

## you can catch me:

- fine im using docker now
- building things nobody asked for
- writing weird tools that only i will use

hit me up if you want someone to argue with :3

## homelab

> **NOTE:** its offline for a while now, i'll get it back up in a week or two (`est~ Nov 15 2025`)

well technically you cant call it a homelab but thats just semantics.

i host some stuff at [miku.is-a.dev](https://miku.is-a.dev) \- go poke around.

earlier i used [trollmeight](https://github.com/trollmeight)'s domain `vinster.xyz`
and [iostpa](https://iostpa.com/)'s cloudflare account for tunnel :3 go check them out
