# hai chat :3

im a dev and a student.

i mostly write in **zig &lt;3**, **go**, ~~**python**~~, and ~~**typescript (on bun)**~~,
because i like my tools fast, and simple. i use **arch, btw**.

<Player client:idle />

## im currently working on:

- [my homelab](#homelab)

if it involves performance, systems, or building cursed stuff, im in.

## tech i use
<Tech />

## you can catch me:

- fine im using docker now
- building things nobody asked for
- writing weird tools that only i will use

hit me up if you want someone to argue with :3

## oh and also about postmiku labs

i have this small thing called [postmiku labs](https://vinster.xyz) (this url might be offline, its on my homelab)
so yeah, i will be doing some of my projects under [here](https://git.vinster.xyz/postmiku).

## homelab

well technically you cant call it a homelab but thats just semantics.

i host some stuff at [vinster.xyz](https://vinster.xyz) \- go poke around.
