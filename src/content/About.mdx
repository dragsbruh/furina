# hai chat :3

im a dev and a student.

i mostly write in **typescript (on bun)**, _**zig &lt;3**_, **go**, and ~~**python**~~, 
because i like my tools fast, and simple. i use **arch, btw**.

<Player client:idle />

## i'm currently working on:

- a web framework
- a system wide wpm tracker
- experimenting with markov chains
- a chip-8 emulator
- ...or probably rewriting something i already finished

if it involves performance, systems, or building cursed stuff, i'm in.

## you can catch me:

- refusing to use docker (podman \<3)
- building things nobody asked for
- writing weird tools that only i will use

hit me up if you want someone to argue with :3

## oh and also im based *nwn*

ah yes i have identity crisis so you can look up [based.is-a.dev](https://based.is-a.dev)
or [based.nya.pub](https://based.nya.pub) both of which will soon be repurposed to be a
landing page for basedhq, under which i will be publishing most of my projects.
