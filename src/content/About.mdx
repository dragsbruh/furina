## supported organizations

- [fight chat control](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/)

  chat control sucks, where the hell is europe going. im glad im not in europe but this
  is gonna spread like cancer, if you are in europe PLEASE [take action](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/#contact-tool),
  it wont take much of your time and helps EVERYONE

- [consumer rights wiki](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Main_Page)

  i cant believe that we need this, shouldnt this be the government's job to prevent
  companies from screwing over everyone?? i thought government was FOR the people BY
  the people. i highly doubt it now.

- [futo.org](https://futo.org)

  god bless open source, and god bless futo for funding it.

- [graphene os](https://grapheneos.org)

  google is ruining android now, and grapheneos is one of the GREAT operating systems that
  are made by people who care about your privacy.

  grapheneos is currently [under attack](https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/115575997104456188)
  from the french state and media, who are actively trying to build a stereotype in public
  that privacy is for _criminals_. they just want mass surveillance.

## shoutout to some morons

- [collective "shut"](https://www.collectiveshout.org)

  oh you idiots, you want everyone to think youre doing a great help to everyone but you morons
  just want to censor everything that you dont like dont you? i always love it when someone
  uses _"b-but its for the kids"_ as an excuse, you incompetent fucks you barely contribute
  to society in a positive way other than shutting down everything that people love even if
  it is not morally, ethically or legally wrong.

- european governments

  god bless the countries that care about its citizens, and fuck those that try to censor everything
  and establish mass surveillance. especially the online safety act, _"b-but its for the kids"_ my ass
  you ALWAYS have to use that excuse for EVERYTHING you incompetent fucks.

- the us government

  i dont even need to say anything about these people, you already know that they are absolute morons.

i hope these orgs clear their name from these sections, or atleast be overthrown for the good.
